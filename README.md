# Database

This application creates a database that interconnects Authors with the number of Books that they have individually written. The interconnection is done through 2 separate tables (Author, Book), which are connected through the ID of each Author. To create this connection, I created a DAO for the Author class and a DAO for the Book class. Test and integration tests are being made to test the function of the applications and the connection of DAO with the database.
